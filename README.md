# FrontBackLinkEnd

**A Simple Frontend and Backend Project.**

Prerequisites

1. VS Code (IDE)
2. NodeJS

Added a status label above the chat — showing:
what context the chatbot currently has
whether the chatbot is using Mock replies (no backend yet)
or API mode (calling FastAPI)

Created a virtual environment on local machine.
